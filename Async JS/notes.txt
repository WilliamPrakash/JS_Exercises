synchronous code means only one statement can only
    be executed one line at a time, meaning a database call 
    will force the executing code to wait for the data to return
^^^ this is known as "blocking code"
however this can be solved with asynchronous code
sync code: start something now, finish it later 

statement 1
statement 2 -> takes time -> database call
statement 3                        |
statement 4                        |
callback   <-----------------------| 

since statement 2 is finishing later, 
    we pass it a callback function as a parameter
the callback function is the thing that runs and finishes 
    once the data comes back
since statement 2 is asynchronous,the browser actually
    takes it and handles it outside the scope of this single thread.
    it also takes a callback function and puts it aside so it knows 
    to execute it later on when the data comes back/task is finished executing
